* Reading from a text file.
* Pretty much simple with these steps;
*
* 1. use File object to represent the file
* 2. FileReader to do the actual reading and
* 3. BufferedReader to make the reading more efficient
*
* NB: Reading happens in a while loop and ends when ReadLine() returns null
* The most common style to reading data or anything that's NOT a serialized object
